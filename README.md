# Mario Kart DS Wiimmfi Dashboard app

#### _My first complete React project!_

This app allows Mario Kart DS online players to easily check who's connected to Wiimmfi and be notified when someone joins or leaves without having to constantly refresh the page or interact with the website at all!

It sends requests in an interval defined by the user (5 to 20 seconds) to a server that instantly scrapes players data from the Wiimmfi.de website (names, friend codes, online statuses) and sends it back to the app.

By enabling the sound option, the app will play a sound effect every time a player connects to or disconnects from the game, making matchmaking much easier and faster!
